Linear Regression and Gradient Descent Algorithm Project
Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression using Gradient Descent for optimizing the model's parameters. Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in machine learning, used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a continuous dependent variable (target).

Gradient Descent is an optimization technique used to minimize the cost function by iteratively updating the parameters (weights and bias) to reach the optimal solution.

The project is implemented in Python and can be run on platforms like Google Colab or a local environment.

Project Overview
The project aims to build a simple Linear Regression model from scratch and optimize it using the Gradient Descent algorithm. The model predicts a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. This project also covers:

Understanding the cost function (Mean Squared Error).
Implementing Gradient Descent to minimize the cost function.
Visualizing the linear regression line and convergence of the cost function over iterations.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used to code the algorithm.
NumPy: For numerical computations, especially array manipulation and mathematical operations.
Matplotlib: Used for plotting and visualizing data and model performance.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and loading datasets.
Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook: For running the project in a notebook environment.

Results
Linear Regression Line: The model fits a line to the data points by minimizing the cost function.
Cost Function Plot: The plot shows the convergence of the cost function as the number of iterations increases.
Final Parameters: After the gradient descent optimization, the final values of the weights and bias are displayed.
The model performance can be evaluated based on how well the line fits the data, and additional metrics like R-squared can be computed to measure goodness of fit.
